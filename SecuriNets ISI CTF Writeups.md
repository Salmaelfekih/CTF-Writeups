<audio controls>
  <source src="Attachments\0RB1t 2.wav" type="audio/wav">
  <p>The content of the file is not supported in this browser.</p>
</audio>

### Solution
Examining the audio provided. It seemed to be Morse code encoded that needs to be decoded.
we looked for an online Morse code audio decoder and used [morsecode.world](https://morsecode.world), which gave the following message as detailed in the screenshot below :

<img src="Images/12.png">

Considering the message that we got, we visited the hacker’s X profile. While going through the account, we discovered an interesting post which was his personal CV which revealed the hacker’s identity and redirected us to Martin’s LinkedIn profile.

<img src="Images/13.png">

Analyzing the LinkedIn profile, particularly the contact info section, we got Martin's personal email.

<img src="Images/14.png">

Having the email address of Martin allowed us to uncover additional information about the hacker using [**Epieos**](https://epieos.com), an OSINT search engine that allows you to perform an email or phone reverse lookup. Epieos provided a Google Maps link, with the result shown in the screenshot below:

### Description 
>One Friday night, while monitoring the position of an Oil tanker that carried crude oil from Saudi Arabia to Senegal, you noticed a suspicious deviation from its usual itinerary. To learn more about this anomaly, you tried to contact the captain responsible for the ship's lead, but in vain. A few minutes later, the phone rang; fortunately, you managed to record the strange call.
Attached to the task are a few files that you collected as evidence for your investigation.

#### The following files were attached to the challenge in a ZIP file.

#### File 1 = audio File :
<audio controls>
  <source src="Attachments\Call.wav" type="audio/wav">
  <p>The content of the file is not supported in this browser.</p>
</audio>

#### File 2 = TXT File:
<object data="Attachments\L0C4TI0N.txt" type="text/plain" width="600" height="400">
<p>The content of the file is not supported in this browser.</p>
</object>

### Solution
In this challenge, we received a ZIP file that needed to be extracted. After extracting it, we found two files: the first was an audio file named call, and the second was a TXT file named L0C4TI0N, which we assumed to represent the last known location of the ship before the call.
First, when we played the audio file, it sounded like a person speaking, but the language was unfamiliar. To transcribe the audio, we first needed to identify the spoken language. Given the L0C4TI0N file, we suspected it might provide a clue. Opening the file, we found the following random string: 
```
knktwgxu
```
Since we knew the file contained a location, we searched for a tool that could decode location-based strings. When we Googled the phrase "latitude and longitude into a short string of letters," we found a result suggesting that it might be a geohashed location.  

To verify this, we used the [Movable Type geohashing](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/geohash.html) tool, which can encode latitude and longitude into a string or decode a string back into coordinates. After decoding the string, we obtained an exact location as shown in the following image:

<img src="Images/19.png">

The result placed the ship near Angola and the Republic of Congo, meaning the language spoken in the audio was either French or Portuguese, as these two countries’ official languages are French and Portuguese. Since it did not sound like French, we proceeded with the assumption that it was Portuguese.  

After transcribing the audio into text using [Turbo Transcriptor](https://turboscribe.ai), we obtained the following text:

<img src="Images/20.png">

Next, we copied the transcribed text and translated it into English, giving the following result:

```
The ship is under control. No one can move here, and the entire crew is now detained. Thanks to our genius, the pirate captain named Mamadou76589, the mission was a success. If you want the crew to survive, you will have to pay a ransom.
```

From this translation, we learned that the pirate captain’s name was `Mamadou76589`. This nickname appeared to be a username.  

We used DCrawl, a powerful OSINT tool for username search across platforms. The results revealed an Instagram account, as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="Images/21.png">

While investigating the Instagram profile, we examined the highlights, which caught our attention:

<img src="Images/22.jpg">

<img src="Images/23.jpg">

While analyzing the text in the Instagram stories, we hypothesized that a file might be embedded within the call audio file. Since steghide is a Linux tool that can extract hidden files from WAV audio files, we attempted extraction

However, the extraction required a passphrase.  

Returning to the Instagram account for further investigation, we discovered a Threads profile linked in the bio. 

<img src="Images/24.jpg">

While examining the Threads profile, we found a post containing a promotional code, as shown in the following image:

<img src="Images/25.jpg">

Using this code as the passphrase for steghide, we successfully extracted a new TXT file named `FLAG101` that had been embedded into the audio file.

<img src="Images/26.png"> 

When we opened the file, we found the flag, but it was missing the last character, as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="Images/27.png">

The hint suggested that the missing character corresponded to the number of times Mamadou had changed his Instagram username.  

A quick Google search led us to an article explaining how to determine the number of times a user has changed their Instagram username by consulting the About this account section on Instagram, as detailed more in the given Screenshot :

<img src="Images/28.jpg">

Using this information, we determined the final character was `4` and finally obtained the complete flag!

### Description 
> Can you give me the Registry expiry date of baobab experience?

>FLAG FORMAT: Securinets{YYYY-MM-DD}

>AUTHOR: S4LM4

### Solution
By conducting research on Google about « What does registry expiry date mean? » You will find out that Registration Expiry Date refers to the final day of the registration term of a Domain Name.

So , we need to look for the website of Baobab Experience. But, how can we find its registry expiry date?

Through our research on Google, we learned about a Linux command-line called “whois” that can provide valuable information about websites.

Running that command-line on our terminal, we got this information.

### Solution
Examining the provided image, we noticed the meta logo. the first hint that came to mind was to analyze the image metadata using ExifTool, which we ran on the Linux terminal. This provided us with valuable information, including a link to a pastebin post, as detailed more on the given screenshot :

<img src="Images/31.png">

Following the pastebin link, it redirected us to H4ck3er_2, where a suspicious message was posted, as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="Images/32.png">

Reading the message, we understood that something had been posted, but it was now deleted. So, we need to bring it back. [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) an online internet archive that allows users to go "back in time" to see how websites looked in the past. The following screenshots show  captures of the hacker account posts from the past:

<img src="Images/33.png">

The image above shows the content in a file named Flag, which contained an unreadable string. We concluded that it needed to be decoded using a popular online decoder, [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr).

<img src="Images/34.png">

Now we've got the flag!
